# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## Required Homework / Tasks

### Instrument Honeycomb.io with (OTEL) into the backend-flask application
I followed along with Andrew's Week 2 class, signed up for Honeycomb.io and added the Honeycomb.io code to connect it to my backend-flask/app.py file:

### Run queries to explore traces within Honeycomb.io
I followed along, created a trace, and added the multispan trace as Jessica Kerr suggested:

### Added npm i to gitpod.yml for frontend-flask-js
I had wondered why we hadn't done this before so I'm glad we added it to gitpod.yml
