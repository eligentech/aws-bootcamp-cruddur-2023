# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## Required Homework / Tasks

### Instrument Honeycomb.io with (OTEL) into the backend-flask application
I followed along with Andrew's Week 2 class, signed up for Honeycomb.io and added the Honeycomb.io code to connect it to my backend-flask/app.py file:

### Run queries to explore traces within Honeycomb.io
I followed along, created a trace, and added the multispan trace as Jessica Kerr suggested:

### Added npm i to gitpod.yml for frontend-flask-js
I had wondered why we hadn't done this before so I'm glad we added it to gitpod.yml

### Instrument AWS X-Ray into backend flask application
I watched and followed along with Andrew's follow-up video on X-Ray, created an xray-json file and created a crudder group in X-Ray from the Terminal

### Configure and provision X-Ray daemon within docker-compose and send data back to X-Ray API
I added the x-ray Daemon code into docker-compose to provision the X-Ray daemon:

### Observe X-Ray traces within the AWS Console
After running Compose UP on docker-compose, opening up the backend in my browser, and hitting refresh a few times I started to see data coming through into the AWS X-Ray Console.

Tracet map of data:

After we added code to track subsegment activity it started to show up in the console to:
